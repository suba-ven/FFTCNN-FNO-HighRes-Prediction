# FFTCNN-FNO-HighRes-Prediction

To-Dos (5/4):
- 2d prediction
  - Load Darcy Dataset for both tasks (FNO and FFT)
  - FNO: set up normalization and training pipeline
    - Can experiment with hyperparameters (num layers, number of Fourier Modes to keep in each direction)
  - FFT CNN: set up normalization and log stuff + training
    -  Experiment with model architectures to find one with good performance
- Future tasks = 3d prediction, clock time inferencing
