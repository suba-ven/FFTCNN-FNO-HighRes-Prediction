# FFTCNN-FNO-HighRes-Prediction

Our two main experiments, one using the FFTCNN approach, the other using the FNO approach, are contained in notebooks 'fft-cnn.ipynb' and 'fnp.ipynb' respectively. 

Most of this is code that we wrote ourselves, however please note that we did use generated code in order to streamline tasks such as the training logic and data visualization. All functions in the code contain comments to explain functionality.
